### Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm John. I manage server administration for GWIT at The George Washington University.

Part of that work involves managing GW's GitHub Enterprise for Education offering.

If you're a student, faculty member, or staff member at GWU, you can join our [main community organization](https://github.com/gwuniversity) by raising an issue in this repository: [GWUniversity-SelfInvite](https://github.com/gwuniversity/GWUniversity-SelfInvite)


If you need more specific help, or have some ideas on how you'd like to use GitHub to support your project, course, or IT worlflow you can email: gwgithub@groups.gwu.edu . One of the GitHub administration team will help you.

P.S.

Hippos ðŸ¦› are vastly underrated and would be a mascot that would make the group proud.
